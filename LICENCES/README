Most of this distribution is licensed under the terms of the Sun
Industry Standards Source License; see the file SISSL.  It is unclear
what the effect is of its the `Standards' language.  At the time of
writing (January 2011) the reference to the "Reference Build binaries"
from the relevant page on the gridengine.sunsource.net site (dumped as
file "standards" in this directory) is a broken link to what appears
to have been a (long-obsolete) version 5.3, and an announcement has
been made of the imminent closure of gridengine.sunsource.net.  This
version hasn't yet been checked against a Sun-released version with
the procedure described in doc/compatibility_test.html, but presumably
a positive compatibility test result against any such version is
sufficient to justify the naming, which is a requirement of the SISSL
EXHIBIT B.  This version is likely not compatible on the wire with any
Sun-released version -- many (most?) of which were incompatible with
each other -- so it will probably be necessary to maintain a
compatibility mode against 6.2u5.  However, the code which changes the
qmaster communication is from the original gridengine repository.
