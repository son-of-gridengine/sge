.SH NAME
accounting \- Grid Engine accounting file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
An accounting record is written to the Grid Engine
accounting file
.I $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/reporting
for each finished job if
.B accounting=true
is specified in the
.M sge_conf 5
.BR reporting_params .
This occurs at intervals of the
.B accounting_flush_time
specified in the same place.
The accounting file is processed by
.M qacct 1
to derive accounting statistics.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
Each job is represented by a line in the accounting file. Empty lines,
and lines which contain one character or less are ignored by
.IR qacct .
Accounting record entries are
separated by colon (':') characters. The entries denote in their order
of appearance:
.SS "\fBqname\fP"
Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.
.SS "\fBhostname\fP"
Name of the execution host.
.SS "\fBgroup\fP"
The effective group id of the job owner when executing the job.
.SS "\fBowner\fP"
Owner of the Grid Engine job.
.SS "\fBjob_name\fP"
Job name.
.SS "\fBjob_number\fP"
Job identifier (job number).
.SS "\fBaccount\fP"
An account string as specified by the
.M qsub 1
or
.M qalter 1
\fB\-A\fP option.
.SS "\fBpriority\fP"
Priority value assigned to the job, corresponding to the \fBpriority\fP
parameter in the queue configuration (see
.M queue_conf 5 ).
.SS "\fBsubmission_time\fP"
Submission time.
.SS "\fBstart_time\fP"
Start time.
.SS "\fBend_time\fP"
End time.
.SS "\fBfailed\fP"
Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job could not be started on 
the execution host (e.g. because the owner of the job did not have a valid 
account on that machine). If Grid Engine tries to start a job multiple times, 
this may lead to multiple entries in the reporting file corresponding to
the same job ID.
.SS "\fBexit_status\fP"
Exit status of the job script (or Grid Engine-specific status in case
of certain error conditions).
The exit status is determined by following the normal shell conventions.
If the command terminates normally the value of the command is its exit status.
However, in the case that the command exits abnormally, a value of 0200 (octal), 
128 (decimal) is added to the value of the command to make up the exit status.
.P
.RS
For example: If a job dies through signal 9 (SIGKILL) then the exit status 
becomes 128 + 9 = 137.
.RE
.SS "\fBru_wallclock\fP"
Difference between \fBend_time\fP and \fBstart_time\fP (see above).
.SS \fBru_utime\fP
.SS \fBru_stime\fP
.SS \fBru_maxrss\fP
.SS \fBru_ixrss\fP
.SS \fBru_ismrss\fP
.SS \fBru_idrss\fP
.SS \fBru_isrss\fP
.SS \fBru_minflt\fP
.SS \fBru_majflt\fP
.SS \fBru_nswap\fP
.SS \fBru_inblock\fP
.SS \fBru_oublock\fP
.SS \fBru_msgsnd\fP
.SS \fBru_msgrcv\fP
.SS \fBru_nsignals\fP
.SS \fBru_nvcsw\fP
.SS \fBru_nivcsw\fP
These entries follow the contents of the standard Unix rusage
structure as described in
.M getrusage 2 .
Depending on the operating system where the job was executed, some of the
fields may be 0.
.SS "\fBproject\fP"
The project which was assigned to the job.
.SS "\fBdepartment\fP"
The department which was assigned to the job.
.SS "\fBgranted_pe\fP"
The parallel environment which was selected for the job.
.SS "\fBslots\fP"
The number of slots which were dispatched to the job by the scheduler.
.SS "\fBtask_number\fP"
Array job task index number.
.SS "\fBcpu\fP"
The CPU time usage in seconds.
.SS "\fBmem\fP"
The integral memory usage in Gbytes seconds.
.SS "\fBio\fP"
The amount of data transferred in input/output operations (if available).
.SS "\fBcategory\fP"
A string specifying the job category.
This contains a space-separated pseudo options list for the sub, with
components as follows:
.IP "\fB\-U\fP \fIuser_list\fP"
An owner/group ACL list composed from
.M host_conf 5 ,
.M sge_pe 5 ,
And
.M queue_conf 5
.BR user_lists / xuser_lists
entries.  Entries from
.M sge_conf 5
are not considered since they can only cause a job to be
accepted/rejected at submit time.  Omitted if there are no such
configuration entries.
.IP "\fB\-P\fP \fIproject_list\fP"
Like
.BR \-U ,
but for
.BR project / xproject
entries.
.IP "\fB\-u\fP \fIowner\fP"
The owner's user name, if it was referenced in any RQS (see
.M sge_resource_quota 5 ).
Omitted if there was no such reference.
.IP "\fB\-q\fP \fIqueue_list\fP"
The hard queue list (only if one was specified).
.IP "\fB\-masterq\fP \fIqueue_list\fP"
The master queue list (only if one was specified).
.IP "\fB\-l\fP \fIresource_list\fP"
The hard resource list (only if hard resources were specified).
.IP "\fB\-soft \-l\fP \fIresource_list\fP"
The soft resource list (only if soft resources were specified).
.IP "\fB\-pe\fP \fIpe_name pe_range\fP"
The parallel environment specified for the job (only for parallel
jobs).
.IP "\fB\-ckpt \fIckpt_name\fP"
The job's checkpointing environment (only if one was specified).
.IP "\fB\-I \fIy\fP"
Present only for interactive jobs.
.IP "\fB\-ar \fIar_id\fP"
The advance reservation into which the job was submitted (only if one
was specified).
.SS "\fBiow\fP"
The i/o wait time in seconds.
.SS "\fBpe_taskid\fP"
If this identifier is set, the task was part of a parallel job, and was
passed to Grid Engine via the \fBqrsh \-inherit\fP interface.
.SS "\fBmaxvmem\fP"
The maximum vmem size in bytes.
.SS "\fBarid\fP"
Advance reservation identifier. If the job used the resources of an advance
reservation, then this field contains a positive integer identifier; otherwise the
value is "\fB0\fP" .
